On our agenda today is riding up the breathtakingly beautiful Chang la pass, which is a true test of good riding, unbridled passion and ultimate love for the outdoors! The occasional snow and gravel on top of the Chang la might make it an even more adventurous ride! On the other side of the Changla are the beautiful Changthang meadows beyond which, like a glistening jewel, is the Pangong! We will have a sumptuous hot lunch at our campsite located on the lake's banks, take in the beauty of the Pangong and go for a leisurely ride along the water! The sight of the evening sun setting against those differently hued mountains would bowl you over! Sometimes at night, the water shines in the starlight as if it is molten silver!
